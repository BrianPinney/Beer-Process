            How to Brew Beer in a Few Easy steps
        </h1>
        <p>
            Brewing is one of humankind's oldest trades, and it's been practiced by nearly every culture in some way or another. Beer first appeared in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) around 5000 B.C., and its popularity spread to Egypt, China, Greece, Rome and beyond.

        <p>This is the first step of the process and where the first two ingredients — water and malt — will meet. Hot water is mixed with cracked grain in a large vessel commonly known as a “Mash Tun.” Thanks to enzymes present in the malt, starches from the malt are converted into sugars. What brewers are creating in the mash tun is called wort: a sugar-rich liquid made from malt and other grains. This process typically takes 60 to 90 minutes.</p>

        <p>The mash tun is fitted with a false bottom, allowing the brewer to separate the liquid wort from the remaining malt solids. Through gravity (and sometimes a pump), the brewer can separate the wort from the malt and collect it in the boil kettle. As the wort is being collected, the brewer will typically rinse the malt with hot water to ensure all the sugars have been removed and assembled in the kettle.</p>

        <p>With all the wort collected from the malt, the process of boiling begins. The boiling process achieves a few things for the brewer. First, it sterilizes the wort and ensures that only the yeast the brewer chooses will work in the fermenter. Second, the brewer will introduce the third ingredient, hops, into the kettle. The hops also act as an anti-microbial agent, but more importantly, impart bitterness, flavor, and aroma to the beer. Boiling also precipitates proteins from the wort, meaning the brewer has clear wort for the yeast and, ultimately, clear beer for the drinker.</p>

        <details><summary><h2>Fermentation</h2></summary>
        
        <p>The old adage goes, “Brewers only make wort; yeast makes the beer.” And this is very true. A brewer`s job is to provide the best food and the best home for the yeast, producing the final beer the brewer is looking for. The wort is passed through a heat exchanger from the kettle to bring the temperature down to a comfortable level for the yeast. Oxygen is often introduced at this stage as well. Yeast is a flavor that can be manipulated by the temperature of the ferment, the amount of yeast used, and how much oxygen is introduced. Hefeweizens are a great example of yeast flavor, as the wonderful bouquet of banana and clove and smooth mouthfeel are created in the fermenter by essentially stressing the yeast to produce these qualities.</p>
